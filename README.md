# Warp reference Ventral Putamen ROI(s) to Subject Space
This is a modification of a [template app]() for a [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io/apps)-compatible app that is designed to warp an ROI (or set of ROIs) _from_ reference space _to_ subject space.  

This specific version is designed to warp Left and Right masks of the Ventral Putamen to subject space for subsequent processing and analysis (e.g. segmentation and tracking).

## Running the App 

### Inputs

-[anat/t1w](https://brainlife.io/datatypes/58c33bcee13a50849b25879a) - the T1 anatomy for this subject

-[mask [brain]](https://brainlife.io/datatypes/5a281aee2c214c9ba83ce620) - the brain mask for this subjet


### On Brainlife.io

THIS VERSION / REPOSITORY IS NOT TO BE RUN DIRECTLY ON BRAINLIFE.IO.  RATHER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS 

### Running Locally (on your machine) using singularity & docker

Because this is compiled code which runs on singularity, you can download the repo and [run it locally with minimal setup]

### Running Locally (on your machine)

The primary script for this application is located [here](https://github.com/DanNBullock/app-warp_refROI_to_subjSpace/blob/master/CoordTransform.sh), but will require the [MNI T1 template](https://github.com/DanNBullock/app-warp_refROI_to_subjSpace/blob/2e3e26993617897b34e52456d39e24947a09ba0e/CoordTransform.sh#L21) and [brain mask](https://github.com/DanNBullock/app-warp_refROI_to_subjSpace/blob/2e3e26993617897b34e52456d39e24947a09ba0e/CoordTransform.sh#L22).  Examples of the template can be found [here](http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesAtlases/ICBM152NLin2009) and [here](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/Atlases).  Futhermore, this application makes use of [ANTs](http://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ants/), which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs).

### Sample Datasets

TBD

### Output

There is one output type generated by this application:
- [ROIS](https://brainlife.io/datatypes/5be9ea0315a8683a39a1ebd9)

[**ROIS**](https://brainlife.io/datatypes/5be9ea0315a8683a39a1ebd9) - a set of rois, corresponding to the MNI space ROIS found in the `rois` directory of this repository

#### Product.json

Currently not implimented

### Dependencies

This App only requires [singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/), and [ANTs](http://picsl.upenn.edu/software/ants/).
